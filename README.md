# Business Analyst

Hi, I'm Salvador! I’ve spent the last few years managing energy transition projects across different regions, but recently, I’ve developed a strong passion for data analytics and data science while completing my Master’s in Management, specializing in Business Analytics. Now, I’m excited to take the next step in my career and shift from project management to data analytics, where I can apply the new skills I’ve learned.

During my studies and work, I’ve become comfortable with analyzing data, identifying trends, and finding ways to improve processes. I’ve used tools like PowerBI and Python, but what excites me most is the potential of data to tell a story and help businesses make better decisions.

In addition to my technical skills, I speak English and Spanish fluently and am currently learning French (currently B1). Outside of work, I love exploring new data tools and finding creative ways to apply data to solve real-world problems with multicultural teams. I’m ready to bring this passion and my experience into a data-focused role, where I can continue growing and making a positive impact.

Data Science: Conducted a detailed analysis of Spanish wines to identify the factors that contribute to higher ratings. This project involved examining key attributes such as region, price, and type, using data to uncover patterns that influence wine quality. By leveraging predictive models, we aimed to forecast wine ratings based on these characteristics, providing valuable insights for producers, consumers, and retailers alike.

Bid and Project Management: Spearheaded the sales and management strategy for deploying Emergency Restoration System towers in Estonia. This role involved cross-functional collaboration with multiple BUs. Managed the bid and manufacture planning, supplier management, and oversaw logistics to ensure efficient deployment and operational success.

Strategic Market Expansion: Led contract negotiations, partner selection, and market research to introduce a specialized technical product to the Indian market. Overcame high entry barriers and competitiveness by selecting a local partner, navigating regulatory environments, and winning the first tender in India. This project enhanced my ability to handle regulatory compliances, stakeholder interactions, and strategic market entry.
