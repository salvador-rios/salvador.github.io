# Business Analyst

Hi, I'm Salvador! I’ve spent the last few years managing energy transition projects across different regions, but recently, I’ve developed a strong passion for data analytics and data science while completing my Master’s in Management, specializing in Business Analytics. Now, I’m excited to take the next step in my career and combine project management with data analytics, where I can apply the new skills I’ve learned.

During my studies and work, I’ve become comfortable with analyzing data, identifying trends, and finding ways to improve processes. I’ve used tools like PowerBI and Python, but what excites me most is the potential of data to tell a story and help businesses make better decisions.

In addition to my technical skills, I speak English and Spanish fluently and am currently learning French (B1). Outside of work, I love exploring new data tools and finding creative ways to apply data to solve real-world problems with international teams. I’m ready to bring this passion and my experience into a data-focused role, where I can continue growing and making a positive impact.

#### Predicting and Understanding Spanish Wine Ratings

[Code](/projects/Predicting_and_Understanding_Spanish_Wine_Ratings.ipynb)

Skills: data cleaning, EDA, correlation matrix, feature engineering, pipelines

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pipelines, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, RandomForest, Tensorflow

Description: Wine is not just a drink, it's a culture, especially in Spain, where winemaking is an integral part of life. This project analyzes a dataset of Spanish wines, aiming to understand what makes a great wine. We explore various factors like wine regions, prices, and types to uncover patterns, and then predict the ratings of these wines based on those features.

The key questions are:

What factors (such as region or price) correlate with higher wine ratings?
Can we predict the quality of wine based on its attributes?
The insights gained from this project could be useful for wine producers, connoisseurs, and even businesses in the hospitality industry.

#### Cleaning and Preprocessing the Sales Data of a Coffeeshop

[Code](/)

Skills: data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, identifying outliers)

Tools Used: Python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib

Description: This project focuses on the preprocessing and visualization of a synthetic cafe sales dataset. The dataset comprises 10,000 rows of sales transactions, each detailing various aspects of individual sales. The primary goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, correct invalid entries, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.
