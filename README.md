# PM/Data Analyst

Hi, I’m Salvador! After managing energy transition projects across different regions, I developed a passion for data analytics while completing my Master’s in Business Analytics. Now, I’m excited to combine my project management experience with my new data skills.

Through my studies and work, I’ve become proficient at analyzing data, identifying trends, and improving processes using tools like PowerBI and Python. What excites me most is how data can tell stories and help businesses make smarter decisions.

I’m fluent in English and Spanish, and currently learning French (B1). Outside of work, I enjoy traveling and going for runs in new places. I’m eager to bring my skills and passion to a data-focused role where I can continue growing and making an impact.

### Projects

Below you will find my portfolio of data science/analytics projects describing the technology stack used to solve them.

#### Predicting and Understanding Spanish Wine Ratings

[Code](/projects/Predicting_and_Understanding_Spanish_Wine_Ratings.ipynb)

Skills: Data Cleaning, EDA, Correlation Matrix, Feature Engineering, Pipelines

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, RandomForest, Tensorflow

Description: Wine is not just a drink, it's a culture, especially in Spain, where winemaking is an integral part of life. This project analyzes a dataset of Spanish wines, aiming to understand what makes a great wine. We explore various factors like wine regions, prices, and types to uncover patterns, and then predict the ratings of these wines based on those features.

The key questions are:

What factors (such as region or price) correlate with higher wine ratings?
Can we predict the quality of wine based on its attributes?
The insights gained from this project could be useful for wine producers, connoisseurs, and even businesses in the hospitality industry.

#### Cleaning and Preprocessing the Sales Data of a Coffeeshop

[Code](/projects/cafe_sales.ipynb)

Skills: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Encoding Categorical Variables, Identifying Outliers)

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Description: This project focuses on the preprocessing and visualization of a synthetic cafe sales dataset. The dataset comprises 10,000 rows of sales transactions, each detailing various aspects of individual sales. The primary goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, correct invalid entries, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.

Key Focus Areas:

Handling missing values through imputation
Encoding categorical variables for model readiness
Detecting and managing outliers for accurate data analysis

#### Cleaning and Preprocessing Financial Data for Defense Contractors

[Code](/projects/defense_contractors.ipynb)

Skills: Data Cleaning, Handling Missing Values, Imputation Using Linear Regression, Outlier Detection and Handling (Log Transformation), EDA

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Description:
In this project, I tackled a financial dataset related to defense contractors. The goal was to handle missing values using linear regression imputation, address outliers through log transformation, and conduct exploratory data analysis to understand financial patterns. The cleaned and transformed dataset allows for more accurate analysis and predictive modeling.

Key Focus Areas:

Imputation of missing values using linear models
Outlier handling through log transformation
Visualizing data distributions before and after transformations
